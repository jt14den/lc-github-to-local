## Introduction

People working in library- and information-related roles are often a resource for authors writing material of all sorts. This is especially the case when it comes to writing Masters Theses or Ph.D. dissertations which require considerable review of any and all literature for a given topic area. Libraries are an important resource when it comes to connecting authors with databases, journals, books, and other resources that can help with the topic being studied, but they can also help with identifying and connecting authors with tools that can aid with the research and writing process, from reference management tools to Git. 

Git can be an invaluable tool for authors and people working in library- and information-related roles to collaborate, share, and version work throughout the thesis and dissertation process and it is the scenario that is used to frame this lesson.
